    <h1> Hello, I am <br> JONATHAN SANON </h1>
</section>
<section class="home-intro">
    <p>
        I'm a curious, driven, and recently graduated programmer who thrives on creating. From building games and
        desktop tools to designing web and mobile applications, I love transforming ideas into functional, impactful
        projects.
        <br><br>
        I’ve completed my Computer Programming diploma at La Cité Collégiale, gaining hands-on experience with frontend
        and backend development, databases, networking fundamentals, and application design. For me, the best way to
        grow as a developer is by doing, experimenting, breaking things, and learning from every challenge along the
        way.
        <br><br>
        This portfolio is more than a showcase; it’s a reflection of my journey, the skills I’ve built, and the progress
        I continue to make as I take on new challenges in the tech world. I give every project my best shot to avoid
        being the one stopping myself.
