    <h1> Hello, I am <br> JONATHAN SANON </h1>

<section class="home-intro">
    <p>
        I'm an active, curious and driven programming student who thrives on creating. Whether it's building games, desktop tools, or web applications, I love turning ideas into real, functional projects. 
        <br><br>
        I believe the best way to grow as a developer is by doing â€” experimenting, breaking things, and learning from every line of code. This portfolio is more than just a showcase; it's a reflection of my journey, my challenges, and the progress I'm making as I evolve in the tech world.
        <br><br>
        I give everything my best shot to avoid being the one stopping myself.
