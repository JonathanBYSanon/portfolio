    Hello, I am <br />
    JONATHAN SANON

  <h2>WHO AM I ?</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a passionate full-stack programmer with hands-on experience in web,
    desktop, and mobile development. I specialize in transforming ideas into
    clean, functional, and impactful digital products, from engaging games like
    <em>Le Banquier</em> and <em>Tijwet</em> to complete applications such as
    <em>My Biblio App</em> and <em>Green Data</em>. <br /><br />
    After earning my Computer Programming diploma at La Cité Collégiale, I’ve
    continued expanding my technical range across modern frameworks (Vue.js,
    React, SwiftUI, Node.js, C# WPF) and database systems (SQL, SQLite,
    MongoDB). My curiosity keeps me exploring new technologies, recently
    including AI-assisted development through GitHub Copilot.
    <br /><br />
    Certified in CCNA Networking, AI Pair Programming, and Emergency First Aid,
    I bring a balance of technical precision and human adaptability. My goal is
    simple: to build reliable, scalable, and creative solutions that make a real
    impact and to never be the one stopping myself.
